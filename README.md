# etchasketch
First try on Etch-A-Sketch theOdinProject

-Learnt how to use queryselectors and eventlisteners.
-Learned how to loop but need to practice a bit more to get it down packed.
-^same as above for the DOM creations and appends. Need to get more comfortable with em
-learned about the 'range' input type.
-learned how to drop shadow instead of using borders to have a more 'clean' sligtly 3d experience.
-got more comfortable with using transform and transition effects on css
-used a slightly bigger blurry box behind the random button to give it a rainbow dropshadow. 

Things I need to work on :
-Cleaner code
-More commits
-Alternatives to what i did with the random button
-break my giant function into smaller pieces?
-How to rainbow colorize each seperate pixel. Im thinking i can use the function foreach() to do it but im not sure how
